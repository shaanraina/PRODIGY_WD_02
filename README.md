Explanation

HTML: The structure remains the same, but the button order is adjusted for better UX.

CSS:
Background gradient for the body to give a modern look.
Enhanced styling for the stopwatch container with more padding, rounded corners, and a subtle box-shadow.
Improved button styles with rounded corners, hover effects, and active states.
Styled lap list with alternating row colors and a scrollable area.

JavaScript:
Added color change for the startStopBtn when the stopwatch is running (to orange for "Pause" state).
Rest of the functionality remains the same with start, stop, reset, and lap features.
This implementation results in a more visually appealing and user-friendly stopwatch web application.
